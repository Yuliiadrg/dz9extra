Extra:
Using different values of the display property and indents, create a "Weather Forecast". The link to the layout in Figma is here.

Requirements:
Cities are a list
DO NOT USE FLOAT FLEX GRID!
To place bridges in the "grid" we use display: inline-block;
Make the width of each point in percentages (for example: width: 50%)
For the effect of changing transparency, we use :hover and opacity
We take the icons from here - link

For smooth animations, we use the CSS code: *{transition: all .1s ease-in;}
